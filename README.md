# Brain Tumor MRI Image Classification

## Problem Statement
This project classifies brain MRI images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor using Deep Learning models.

## Dataset
- Source: Brain Tumor MRI Multi-Class Dataset
- Structure: train/, valid/, test/ folders each with 4 tumor classes

## Project Workflow
1. Dataset exploration
2. Data preprocessing
3. Data augmentation
4. Custom CNN model
5. Transfer learning models
6. Model training
7. Model evaluation
8. Model comparison
9. Streamlit deployment

## Deliverables
- Trained models (.h5)
- Streamlit app (`app.py`)
- Python scripts or notebooks
- Model comparison results
- Clean, modular, and commented code

## Technical Tags
Deep Learning, CNN, Transfer Learning, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Medical Imaging, Streamlit Deployment
